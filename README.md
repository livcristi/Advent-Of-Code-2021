# Advent-Of-Code-2021
Personal solutions to AoC 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/)

Last year I achieved the goal of completing every problem of the AoC 2020. 

Now, of course I want to repeat that, it's fun and you learn something new every day. But, I want this to be more challenging. 
So, every day I will solve the problem in a different programming language. That's my goal.
